## Dynamic Breakout Strategy

The Dynamic Breakout strategy implements a dynamic threshold mechanism using Donchian Channels with additional trend and volatility filters. This strategy identifies breakout opportunities when price exceeds the upper or lower Donchian channel, but only when confirmed by trend and volatility conditions.

### Core Trading Logic
The strategy combines three key components:
1. **Donchian Channels**: Price bands based on the highest high and lowest low over a specified period
2. **EMA Trend Filter**: Ensures trades align with the medium-term trend direction
3. **ATR Volatility Filter**: Confirms that breakouts occur during periods of sufficient volatility

The strategy generates buy signals when:
- Price closes above the previous period's upper Donchian channel
- Price is above the EMA filter line (indicating an uptrend)
- Current bar range exceeds ATR multiplied by the volatility multiplier

Sell signals are generated when:
- Price closes below the previous period's lower Donchian channel
- Price is below the EMA filter line (indicating a downtrend)
- Current bar range exceeds ATR multiplied by the volatility multiplier

### Key Parameters
- **donchian_period**: Period for Donchian Channel calculation (default: 20)
- **ema_filter_period**: Period for EMA trend filter (default: 50)
- **atr_period**: Period for Average True Range calculation (default: 14)
- **atr_multiplier**: Multiplier for ATR volatility filter (default: 0.8)

### Market Conditions for Optimal Performance
This strategy performs best in trending markets with moderate to high volatility. It excels when:
- Clear directional trends are present
- Volatility is sufficient to generate meaningful breakouts
- Market noise is filtered by the EMA and ATR conditions

The adaptive threshold mechanism helps avoid false breakouts in choppy or low-volatility markets by requiring confirmation from multiple filters.

## Mercy Edge Strategy

The Mercy Edge strategy implements a risk-aware entry logic through a hybrid approach that combines multiple technical indicators with AI validation for high-precision signals.

### Core Trading Logic
Mercy Edge employs a multi-condition confirmation system that requires alignment across three analytical dimensions:
1. **Trend Direction**: Determined by comparing price to a 200-period SMA (proxy for daily trend)
2. **Momentum**: Assessed using MACD histogram values
3. **Entry Timing**: Validated by Stochastic oscillator crossovers

The strategy generates buy signals only when all three conditions are met:
- Price is above the 200-period SMA (uptrend confirmation)
- MACD histogram is positive (bullish momentum)
- Stochastic %K line crosses above %D line (short-term bullish momentum)

Sell signals are generated when:
- Price is below the 200-period SMA (downtrend confirmation)
- MACD histogram is negative (bearish momentum)
- Stochastic %K line crosses below %D line (short-term bearish momentum)

This multi-layered confirmation system creates a "mercy" filter that prevents entries during uncertain market conditions.

### Key Parameters
- **macd_fast**: Fast EMA period for MACD (default: 12)
- **macd_slow**: Slow EMA period for MACD (default: 26)
- **macd_signal**: Signal line period for MACD (default: 9)
- **stoch_k**: %K period for Stochastic (default: 14)
- **stoch_d**: %D period for Stochastic (default: 3)
- **stoch_smooth**: Smoothing period for Stochastic (default: 3)

### Market Conditions for Optimal Performance
Mercy Edge performs best in markets with clear trends and defined momentum. It is particularly effective when:
- Strong directional moves are developing
- Momentum indicators confirm trend direction
- Short-term pullbacks provide entry opportunities

The strategy's risk-aware design makes it suitable for volatile markets where false signals are common, as the multiple confirmation requirements help filter out noise.

## Pulse Sync Strategy

The Pulse Sync strategy implements momentum synchronization by aligning multiple technical indicators across different analytical dimensions to confirm trading signals.

### Core Trading Logic
Pulse Sync synchronizes three key market aspects:
1. **Trend Filter**: Medium-term trend direction using SMA (default 100-period)
2. **Momentum Confirmation**: MACD histogram for trend strength
3. **Entry Trigger**: Stochastic crossover for precise timing

The strategy's logic flows through a hierarchical confirmation process:
- First, the trend direction is established by comparing price to the SMA
- Then, MACD confirms the momentum in the trend direction
- Finally, Stochastic crossover provides the precise entry signal

This synchronization ensures that trades are taken in the direction of the medium-term trend, with momentum confirmation and optimal timing.

### Key Parameters
- **trend_period**: Period for SMA trend filter (default: 100)
- **macd_fast**: Fast EMA period for MACD (default: 12)
- **macd_slow**: Slow EMA period for MACD (default: 26)
- **macd_signal**: Signal line period for MACD (default: 9)
- **stoch_k**: %K period for Stochastic (default: 14)
- **stoch_d**: %D period for Stochastic (default: 3)
- **stoch_smooth**: Smoothing period for Stochastic (default: 3)

### Market Conditions for Optimal Performance
Pulse Sync excels in trending markets with consistent momentum. It performs best when:
- Medium-term trends are well-established
- Momentum indicators show sustained strength
- Market cycles provide clear entry and exit points

The strategy is particularly effective on higher timeframes (H1 and above) where trend signals are more reliable and noise is reduced.

## Quantum Velocity Strategy

The Quantum Velocity strategy implements rate-of-change detection through a sophisticated volatility-based breakout system combined with long-term trend filtering.

### Core Trading Logic
Quantum Velocity combines two powerful concepts:
1. **Long-term Trend Filter**: 200-period EMA to determine overall market direction
2. **Volatility Breakout Trigger**: Bollinger Squeeze detection followed by price breakout

The strategy identifies periods of low volatility (squeeze) when Bollinger Band width falls below a threshold, then waits for a breakout in the direction of the long-term trend.

Buy signals are generated when:
- Price is above the 200-period EMA (bullish trend)
- Previous bar was in a squeeze condition
- Current bar closes above the upper Bollinger Band

Sell signals are generated when:
- Price is below the 200-period EMA (bearish trend)
- Previous bar was in a squeeze condition
- Current bar closes below the lower Bollinger Band

This approach captures the "quantum leap" in price velocity that often occurs after periods of consolidation.

### Key Parameters
- **ema_period**: Period for EMA trend filter (default: 200)
- **bb_length**: Period for Bollinger Bands calculation (default: 20)
- **bb_std**: Standard deviation multiplier for Bollinger Bands (default: 2.0)
- **squeeze_window**: Rolling window for average bandwidth calculation (default: 10)
- **squeeze_factor**: Multiplier for squeeze level threshold (default: 0.7)

### Market Conditions for Optimal Performance
Quantum Velocity performs exceptionally well in markets that alternate between consolidation and expansion phases. It is ideal for:
- Range-bound markets that transition to trending conditions
- Assets with cyclical volatility patterns
- Breakout scenarios following periods of low volatility

The strategy's strength lies in its ability to detect the transition point between low and high volatility regimes.

## Turtle Breakout Strategy

The Turtle Breakout strategy implements a classic trend-following approach based on the original Turtle Trading rules, using price breakout levels for entry and exit signals.

### Core Trading Logic
Turtle Breakout follows a systematic trend-following methodology with explicit entry and exit rules:
- **Entry Logic**: Enter long when price exceeds the highest high of the past N periods; enter short when price falls below the lowest low of the past N periods
- **Exit Logic**: Exit long positions when price falls below the lowest low of the past M periods; exit short positions when price exceeds the highest high of the past M periods

The strategy incorporates position state awareness, checking the current position status before generating entry signals and prioritizing exit signals when already in a position.

### Key Parameters
- **entry_period**: Lookback period for entry channel (default: 20)
- **exit_period**: Lookback period for exit channel (default: 10)

### Market Conditions for Optimal Performance
Turtle Breakout excels in strongly trending markets and performs best when:
- Extended directional moves are present
- Trends have sufficient duration to reach exit levels
- Market volatility supports meaningful price movements

The strategy is particularly effective for capturing major market moves while minimizing whipsaw losses through its systematic approach.

## Implementation and Integration

### Core Integration Requirements
All strategies inherit from the BaseStrategy abstract class, which defines the common interface:
- **Initialization**: Accepts bot instance and parameters dictionary
- **Analysis Method**: Implements the `analyze` method for live trading
- **Backtesting Method**: Implements the `analyze_df` method for vectorized backtesting
- **Parameter Definition**: Implements `get_definable_params` class method

The base strategy enforces a consistent interface while allowing each strategy to implement its specific logic.

### Integration with Core Bot System
Strategies are integrated through the strategy map in strategy_map.py, which registers each strategy with a unique identifier. The core bot system:
1. Loads the appropriate strategy based on configuration
2. Passes market data to the strategy's analyze method
3. Processes the returned signal (BUY, SELL, HOLD)
4. Executes trades according to the signal and risk parameters

### Implementation Nuances
- **State Awareness**: Turtle Breakout demonstrates stateful logic by checking current position status
- **Look-Ahead Prevention**: All strategies use shift(1) on indicator calculations to prevent future data contamination
- **Data Validation**: Strategies include checks for sufficient data before analysis
- **Parameter Flexibility**: All parameters are retrieved with defaults to ensure robustness

The modular design allows for easy addition of new strategies while maintaining consistency across the system.
