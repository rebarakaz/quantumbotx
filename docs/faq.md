### How do I backtest a strategy?
1. Go to the "Backtester" page
2. Select your strategy and market
3. Choose a historical data period
4. Run the backtest
5. Review performance metrics like profit factor and drawdown

## üß™ Backtesting & Data

### Do I need an internet connection for backtesting?
No! Backtesting works completely offline and does not require an internet connection or MT5 terminal. All you need is historical data in CSV format stored in the `lab/backtest_data` directory.

### How do I get historical data for backtesting?
QuantumBotX provides a data download script in the `lab/download_data.py` directory that can automatically download historical data from your MT5 account:

1. Ensure MT5 terminal is running and you're logged in
2. Configure your MT5 credentials in the `.env` file
3. Run the download script:
   ```bash
   python lab/download_data.py
   ```
4. The script will download data for popular symbols and save CSV files to `lab/backtest_data/`

### What format should backtesting data be in?
Backtesting data should be in CSV format with the following columns:
- `time`: Timestamp in any standard format
- `open`: Opening price
- `high`: Highest price
- `low`: Lowest price
- `close`: Closing price
- `volume`: Trading volume

Files should be named using the pattern: `{SYMBOL}_{TIMEFRAME}_data.csv` (e.g., `EURUSD_H1_data.csv`)

### Can I use my own data for backtesting?
Yes! You can use your own historical data by placing CSV files in the `lab/backtest_data` directory with the proper naming convention. This is useful if you have data from other sources or want to test specific market conditions.

### How much historical data do I need?
For meaningful backtesting results, we recommend at least 500 bars (about 2 years of H1 data) for most strategies. More data generally leads to more reliable results, especially for strategies that use longer timeframes or lookback periods.

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Risk Management

### Is QuantumBotX safe to use?
QuantumBotX includes multiple safety features:
- ATR-based position sizing automatically adapts to market volatility

### What happens if I lose connection to MT5?
If connection to MT5 is lost, the system will:
1. Log the error in the application logs
2. Stop all active bots
3. Attempt to reconnect automatically
4. Require manual restart of bots after reconnection

### How do I protect my account from large losses?
Follow these risk management principles:
- Never risk more than 2% of your account per trade
- Always use stop losses
- Start with micro lots (0.01)
- Demo trade for at least 30 days before going live
