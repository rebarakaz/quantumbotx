## 🐧 Linux Setup (Wine Configuration)

Since MetaTrader 5 is Windows-only software, Linux users need to use Wine to run MT5. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### 1. Install Wine
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wine winetricks

# Fedora/CentOS/RHEL
sudo dnf install wine winetricks

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S wine winetricks
```

### 2. Configure Wine Environment
```bash
# Create a new Wine prefix for MT5 (recommended for isolation)
export WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.wine-mt5"
wineboot --init

# Install required Windows components
winetricks corefonts vcrun2019 dotnet48
```

### 3. Download and Install MetaTrader 5
```bash
# Download MT5 installer from your broker's website
# Example for XM Global:
wget https://download.mql5.com/cdn/web/metaquotes.software.corp/mt5/xmglobal5setup.exe

# Install MT5 using Wine
wine xmglobal5setup.exe
```

### 4. Configure Python Environment
```bash
# Set up the project as usual
git clone https://github.com/rebarakaz/quantumbotx.git
cd quantumbotx
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your MT5 credentials
```

### 5. Run QuantumBotX with Wine
```bash
# Start MT5 in Wine (in background)
export WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.wine-mt5"
wine "$HOME/.wine-mt5/drive_c/Program Files/MetaTrader 5/terminal64.exe" &

# Wait for MT5 to fully load, then start QuantumBotX
python run.py
```

### 6. Troubleshooting Tips
- **MT5 Connection Issues**: Ensure MT5 is fully loaded before starting QuantumBotX
- **Wine Performance**: Use `winecfg` to adjust graphics settings for better performance
- **Font Issues**: Install additional fonts with `winetricks corefonts`
- **Memory Issues**: Increase Wine's virtual memory in `winecfg`

### Alternative: Docker Approach
For advanced users, you can also run MT5 in a Windows container:
```bash
# This requires Docker with Windows container support
# Implementation details depend on your specific setup
```

> **Note**: Wine performance may vary depending on your Linux distribution and hardware. For production trading, consider using a dedicated Windows machine or VM.
